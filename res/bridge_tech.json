  "Bridge flooding: during stay of EWB UCL (June 26 to July 7), severe rain occurred on the 30th of June, 5th and 6th of July (lasting 2 hours approx. in each case). No significant flooding of the bridge was observed, but large puddles accumulate on the eastern side where runoff from the elevated eastern side of the campus and the saturated area around the pump accumulate. The bridgeâ€™s concrete surfacing is heavily damaged on this side (probably due to the large volume of water flowing over it) making the area very muddy and difficult to cross following heavy rain.",
  "The puddles dry quickly (usually by the morning following rain) suggesting no major infrastructural work is required on the bridge (i.e. raising the entire bridge or installing additional drainage pipes). Resurfacing (concrete capped with tarmac) would address the problem of puddles forming on the eastern bank. Extending surfacing some distance due east would prevent the undercutting currently observed.",
  "Drainage ditches should be dug to facilitate the through- flow of water from the pump area to the downstream side of the bridge. (Essentially extension and deepening of existing natural drainage paths). Currently the pump is not in operation so flow rates from the well are relatively low. This can increase significantly when pump is in use. Drainage on the eastern bank (bridge entrance) could also be considered to divert the surface runoff although care should be taken to prevent flooding of the vegetable patch on the eastern bank.",
  "Drainage on the north bank: Shallow gradient on both sides of the drainage ditch means water accumulates. Excavating a drainage ditch some 20mts to the lower land due north may be a simple solution to reduce flooding risk."
