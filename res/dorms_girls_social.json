  "Paving around the schools buildings has degraded, stones are missing and / or loose. This poses a significant tripping hazard for the students. Most severe on the western side of the girls dorms where the pavement is stepped up due the slope of the terrain.",
  "When present, gutters surrounding buildings are open, and consist of a line of paving stones cemented vertically in a perimeter surrounding the pavement. Due to degradation of mortar positioned at the edge of pavement this also poses a tripping hazard.",
  "Elevated guttering would be a solution and would be amenable to the installation of a rainwater harvesting system."
