  "Availability of water for showering depends on city and spring water supply. The city water can be cut off for up to one month. When there is no water, students carry water from the standing pipe, which is salty. This requires a minimum of two buckets, and the nannies indicated is not very pleasant for the students.",
  "Lack of appropriate shower facilities (when city water is not working) is especially challenging for female students during menstruation (particularly exacerbated by lack of high quality supplies for female students)",
  "Younger students shower once a week, at the weekends when nannies are available to help. Older students are free to shower when they like and thus may be able to shower more frequently.",
  "There are no lights at night, so some students are afraid to go in the evening.",
  "Female students said they are not allowed to wash their hair in the showers so as to avoid clogging the plugs. They wash their hair outside instead in the middle of the campus with buckets of water.",
  "Nannies report that students suffer from a lack of enough soap/shampoo or underwear."
