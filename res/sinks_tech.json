  "2 wash basins have been installed by EWB UCL July 2014. (1 for girl’s toilet, 1 for boy’s toilet). A water line has been extended from the inside taps.",
  "City water line (20mm) runs along the bridge from east to west and used to supply the sink by the classrooms. It has currently disconnected as the pit latrine previously present was no longer functioning and has been demolished.",
  "The sinks are no longer in use but can be easily reconnected at low cost."
