  "The Area around the well is difficult to access due to saturation of soil and stagnant puddles of water.",
  "The well pump is currently not working likely due to power fluctuations (this is a common cause for defective submersible pumps in the region.) If this is the case, replacement of the pump will be required. (The water resources board likely has spare units following a recent upgrade of well pumps in the region.)",
  "Power fluctuations should no longer be a problem following the upgrade of the electricity meter. (May 2014).",
  "The contractor that installed the pump has been contacted by EWB UCL (July 2014) pending inspection to confirm this is the problem."
