  "The toilets are reported to clog often with sewage odour as a result. This is especially problematic given proximity of girls' dorms. Likely cause is the shallow gradient between the toilet drains and the first observation hole. Clearing of piping with a pipe rod is a short term solution. In the long term steepening the gradient of the first section of sewer pipe or a complete overhaul of this toilet block is needed.",
  "All toilet units are of the squatting type. Most toilet pans have not been placed level with the floor (slightly elevated), making cleaning difficult. Puddles of stagnant water accumulate, aggravating the odour problem and attracting flies, which is especially problematic given the proximity of the dorms.",
  "Connected via septic tank. This is emptied twice in a year by truck, which costs approximately 500BR per trip."
