  "Students use well water to wash hands / feet / faces during the day when municipal water is cut off, collecting the water in buckets or their hands, and bringing this this to different spaces on the campus to perform different washing rituals.",
  "Broken pump means the water is currently rather difficult to collect.",
  "Water not good for consumption, however, some students may opt to collect from this source, particularly if they cannot afford to purchase water from vendors outside of the school.",
  "Path leading to the well is flooded (due to broken pump) and is reported difficult to traverse with muddy, rocky conditions."
